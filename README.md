# 🏠 Housing-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Python
## 🎯 Project Overview
The Housing Price Prediction project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes.
The model helps estimate market value using historical housing data and machine learning algorithms.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze factors influencing housing prices
- Build a predictive machine learning model
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Provide accurate price predictions for unseen data
- Support real estate decision-making with data-driven insights

### 📂 Dataset Description
#### The dataset includes features such as:
- Location
- Area (Square Feet)
- Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms
- Year Built
- Property Type
- Sale Price (Target Variable)
